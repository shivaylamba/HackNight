We built a machine learning model to detect if a skin sample has cancer or not using Azure Cognitive Services <br>
We deployed a web application using Azure Pipeline and Virtual machine to upload an image of the skin sample. <br>
It gives prediction % of the possibility of that skin sample to have cancer. <br>
